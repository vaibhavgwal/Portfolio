				</div>
				<div>
					<p>To facilitate the cutting and mulching of crops like wheat, mustard, leaves etc using a
                        bicycle driven cutting equipment in order to ease the existing conventional system.</p>

				</div>
				<div>
					<p> Being engineers, We wanted to innovate something new, that could really bring a
                        change in someone’s life. With this thought and interest in Product design and
                        development, we decided to work in this field under the supervision of Dr. Ankit
                        Bansal, Assistant Professor, IIT Roorkee for the course Lab based Project.

					<p class="lead "><span>Approach</span> to the problem</p>	
				 </div>
				 <div>
                    <p>We had a team of 4 for this project<br>1. Ujjwal Sharma<br>2. Utsav Rajpal<br>3. Vinod Kumar<br>4. Vaibhav Agarwal</p>
                <p>The following figure shows the progress made by us in bringing the design of 
                    ‘Bicycle based Agricultural equipment’ from random sketches of paper to reality.</p>
                    <img src="images/LBP/Picture1.png" alt=""></div>

                </p><p>After brainstorming for few days, we came up with the notion to develop
                    the agricultural equipment for rural areas. We planned to make a manual, affordable
                    and efficient equipment that can serve the required purposes with ease.</p>
                <p> We recognize that the manual or conventional process of cutting
                    crops is very tedious and time consuming. Alternatives present are very costlier (Min
                    ₹12000), bulky, need expertise and are not affordable for each and every farmer. So,
                    after giving our thought process on this issue, we came up with the idea of a
                    detachable cutting assembly in the front portion of the bicycle. With this notion, we
                    carried out our work and identified the required problem statement for this project.</p>

					<p class="lead "><span>Preliminary</span> Design</p>	
				 </div>
				 <div>
					<p>After discussion we came up with the idea of attaching the cutting blade to the side section of the bicycle. This is the CAD render of the preliminary design.</p>

                    <p>Problems identified in previous design
                        <br>1. Operator cannot observe the cutting action.
                        <br>2. Ergonomically unstable design.
                        <br>3. Only sideways cutting to crops possible.
                        <br>4. Issues related to CG. (Centre of gravity).
                        <br>5. Difficulty in providing extra support to rear structure (Welding limitations).
                        <br>6. Costlier arrangements were required to transverse motion from rear tyre to bevel gears.
                        <br>7. Requires higher torque which will cause fatigue in operator
                    </p>

					<p class="lead "><span>Final</span> Design</p>

                     <p>Isometric view of the final design</p>

                     <p>Characteristics of final design
                        <br>1. Operator can easily observe the cutting action
                        <br>2. Ergonomically more stable design
                        <br>3. Cutting of crops can be done through any section of the field
                        <br>4. CG is now in centre of the equipment (Lesser chances of toppling)
                        <br>5. Stable and user-friendly frame design
                        <br>6. Affordable, efficient and more effective than previous design
                        <br>7. No more work fatigue on operator (Requires lesser torque)

                                <br>3. Aligned coupling of Bevel gears.
                                <br>4. Weight reduction for front part assembly. (Use of hollow pipes)</p>

                        <br>1. Better Suspension system can be incorporated
                        <br>2. Centre of gravity can be made closer to ground level (provided via inclination 
                        of front wheels arrangement)
                        <br>3. Wider tyres can be employed for better traction
                        <br>4. Mechanical advantage of the cutting blade can be improved
                        <br>5. More customizable design can be made 
                        <br>6. Clutch system can be incorporated so as to engage or disengage the blade 
                        when required
                        <br>7. Multiple gear drives can be incorporated in pedal mechanism resulting in lesser 
                        work fatigue
                        <br>8. Frame modifications for swiping crops (after cutting)</p>
